# Photography Blog Backend Checkpoint - May 2025

This file serves as a checkpoint documenting the current working state of the photography blog backend.

## Current Status

All major features are operational:

1. **Content Types**: 
   - Articles
   - Categories
   - Writers
   - Global Settings
   - Homepage

2. **Custom Features**:
   - Batch image upload (fully working)
   - Image focal point selection
   - Gallery management

## Recent Fixes

### Batch Image Upload

The batch image upload feature has been fixed to properly handle multiple files. The issue was resolved by:

1. Modifying how the backend controller processes files from the FormData object
2. Properly handling both single file and multiple file upload scenarios
3. Improving the frontend component to better structure the FormData being sent

The fix allows users to select multiple images and upload them all at once, properly adding them to the article's gallery.

### Focal Point Selection

The focal point functionality was enhanced to:

1. Simplify the UI to only show the visual indicator (red dot)
2. Correctly save and load focal point coordinates
3. Provide proper frontend integration for image display

## Verification Steps

To verify the system is working correctly:

1. **Batch Upload**:
   - Edit any article in the Strapi admin panel
   - Use the batch upload component to select multiple images
   - Click "Upload to Gallery"
   - Verify all selected images appear in the gallery after page refresh

2. **Focal Point**:
   - Select any image in the media library
   - Click on the image to set a focal point
   - Verify the red dot appears at the selected position
   - Verify the focal point coordinates are saved correctly

## Environment

- Strapi version: 4.2.0
- Node.js: v18.17.0
- Database: SQLite (development)

## Next Steps

1. Continue refining the frontend integration
2. Add additional image processing capabilities
3. Enhance gallery layout options
