# Silky Truth: Enhanced Image Handling Guide

This guide explains the improved image handling system for the Silky Truth photography blog. The system is designed to make working with images in articles much easier, providing better visibility, organization, and control.

## Key Features

1. **Larger Image Previews** - Images are displayed at a more useful size for review and editing
2. **Drag-and-Drop Reordering** - Gallery items can be reordered by dragging and dropping
3. **Individual Image Settings** - Each image can have its own caption, alt text, and display size
4. **Better Organization** - All images are grouped in a dedicated gallery component

## How to Use the New Image Gallery

### Adding Images to an Article

1. When editing an article, scroll down to the **Gallery** section
2. You can add images in two ways:
   - Add multiple images at once using the main "Images" field
   - Add individual gallery items with more control over each image

### Reordering Images

1. In the **Gallery Items** section, each image appears as a separate item
2. Grab the handle on the left side of any gallery item
3. Drag the item to its new position in the sequence
4. The order of gallery items determines the display order on the frontend

### Image Display Settings

Each gallery item has several settings:

- **Image**: The actual image file (required)
- **Caption**: Optional text displayed with the image
- **Alt Text**: Important for accessibility (describes the image for screen readers)
- **Display Size**: Controls how large the image appears on the frontend
  - Small: Compact view
  - Medium: Standard size (default)
  - Large: Prominent display
  - Full: Full-width display

## Gallery vs. Featured Image

Your article has two image-related sections:

- **Image**: This is the featured/thumbnail image for the article
- **Gallery**: This contains all the images shown within the article content

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive filenames** for your images before uploading
2. Always provide **alt text** for accessibility
3. Choose **appropriate display sizes** based on image importance
4. Use the **caption field** for photo credits or additional context
5. **Limit gallery size** to a reasonable number of images (10-20) for better performance

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the gallery:

1. Try refreshing the page if drag-and-drop isn't working
2. Ensure you're using supported image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
3. Check image file sizes - large files may take longer to upload
4. If an image isn't displaying correctly, try re-uploading it

## Migrating Existing Content

For articles created before this update:

1. The existing "Images" field data is preserved
2. You'll need to manually create gallery items for each image to use the new features
3. Once you've added all images to gallery items, you can safely remove them from the legacy field
