## Image Focal Point System

The photography blog features a smart focal point system that ensures the most important parts of images remain visible regardless of how they're cropped on different devices.

### How Focal Points Work

1. **Setting Focal Points**: In the Strapi admin panel, content editors can set focal points on images by clicking on the most important area of the image using the ImageFocalPoint component.

2. **Data Storage**: Focal point coordinates are stored as percentages (x, y) in the image's `provider_metadata.focalPoint` field in the database:
   ```json
   "provider_metadata": {
     "focalPoint": {
       "x": 58.39,
       "y": 36.86
     }
   }
   ```

3. **API Integration**: When requesting images through the API, the `provider_metadata` field must be included in the query to retrieve focal point data:
   ```
   /api/articles?populate[image][fields][]=provider_metadata
   ```

4. **Frontend Rendering**: The Image component in the frontend automatically:
   - Detects focal point data in the image attributes
   - Applies CSS `object-position` styling with the focal point coordinates
   - Ensures the focal point stays visible when images are cropped

### Technical Implementation

- **Backend Storage**: Focal points are saved via the `/upload/updateFocalPoint/:id` endpoint
- **CSS Implementation**: The focal point is applied using:
  ```css
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: 58.39% 36.86%; /* Using the focal point x and y values */
  ```
- **Responsive Design**: This ensures that on all screen sizes and aspect ratios, the most important part of the image remains visible

### Benefits

- Improved visual storytelling by keeping the subject in view
- Better responsive design without manual cropping of images
- Consistent user experience across devices

## Easter Eggs

### Konami Code Easter Egg

The website includes a hidden easter egg triggered by entering the Konami Code (‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üê ‚Üí B A).

#### How It Works

1. **Activation**: When a user enters the Konami Code sequence on their keyboard, a character named "Silky" will appear and move across the screen while bobbing up and down.

2. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Uses the `konami` npm package to detect the key sequence
   - Implements smooth animation using `requestAnimationFrame` for both horizontal movement and vertical bobbing
   - Plays a custom sound effect when triggered
   - Supports fallback to SVG icon if the character image is unavailable
   - Works on both desktop and mobile (via touch sequence detection)

3. **Files**:
   - The implementation is in `frontend/components/KonamiEasterEgg.js`
   - Character image: `/public/easter-egg/images/silky.png`
   - Sound effect: `/public/easter-egg/sounds/silky.mp3`

#### Mobile Support

The easter egg can also be triggered on mobile devices by tapping the screen 10 times in quick succession (less than 1.5 seconds between taps).
