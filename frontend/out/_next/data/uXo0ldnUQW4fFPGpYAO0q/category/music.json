An irreplaceable shimmer that feels soothing on the surface yet substantive at its core, ultimately liberating us to see beauty without closing our eyes.","shareImage":{"data":null}}}},"category":{"id":20,"attributes":{"name":"Music","slug":"music","createdAt":"2025-06-05T17:49:37.283Z","updatedAt":"2025-06-05T17:49:37.283Z","articles":{"data":[{"id":16,"attributes":{"publishedAt":"2025-06-05T17:58:05.355Z","title":"Basswitch 7","description":"Basswitch 7 was the summoning of the water witch.
