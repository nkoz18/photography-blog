In that glimmer, the genuine and authentic emerge. An irreplaceable shimmer that feels soothing on the surface yet substantive at its core, ultimately liberating us to see beauty without closing our eyes.","shareImage":{"data":null}}}},"category":{"id":22,"attributes":{"name":"Nature","slug":"nature","createdAt":"2025-06-12T19:41:56.671Z","updatedAt":"2025-06-12T19:41:56.671Z","articles":{"data":[{"id":21,"attributes":{"publishedAt":"2025-06-12T19:49:27.949Z","title":"🌸 Japanese Friendship Garden","description":"The Japanese Friendship Garden, located in San Diego’s Balboa Park, symbolizes the bond of friendship between San Diego and its sister city, Yokohama.","content":"Kongo Rikishi, one of two wrathful Guardian Kings of Buddha, plays a unique role in Buddhist tradition. Often seen standing at the entrance of temples 🏯, baring their teeth and wielding a club, these intimidating figures are thought to deter thieves and evil spirits. Despite the generally pacifist tradition of Buddhism, the stories of these guardians justify the use of physical force to protect cherished values and beliefs against evil.\n\nThe second statue pictured portrays the Kannon Bosatsu, a deity of compassion and mercy. Unlike Buddha, Kannon is considered a Bodhisattva, a being who has the ability to achieve Nirvana but chooses to delay doing so out of compassion for suffering beings.\n\nAs I wandered through the Japanese friendship garden 🌸 🌳, the contrast between these two figures struck me. Together, they embody the duality of strength and compassion that lies at the heart of Buddhist philosophy and within us all.","slug":"japanese-friendship-garden","createdAt":"2025-06-12T19:45:04.600Z","updatedAt":"2025-06-19T10:57:04.870Z","listed":true,"image":{"data":{"id":495,"attributes":{"url":"https://photography-blog-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/japanese_friendship_garden_2_8114e3fcbf.jpg","alternativeText":null,"caption":null}}},"categories":{"data":[{"id":22,"attributes":{"name":"Nature","slug":"nature"}}]},"author":{"data":{"id":3,"attributes":{"name":"Nikita Kozlov"}}}}}]}}},"categories":{"data":[{"id":6,"attributes":{"name":"Events","slug":"events","createdAt":"2025-05-15T23:28:40.533Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-15T23:28:40.533Z"}},{"id":20,"attributes":{"name":"Music","slug":"music","createdAt":"2025-06-05T17:49:37.283Z","updatedAt":"2025-06-05T17:49:37.283Z"}},{"id":21,"attributes":{"name":"Cars","slug":"cars","createdAt":"2025-06-05T18:04:55.829Z","updatedAt":"2025-06-05T18:04:55.829Z"}},{"id":22,"attributes":{"name":"Nature","slug":"nature","createdAt":"2025-06-12T19:41:56.671Z","updatedAt":"2025-06-12T19:41:56.671Z"}}],"meta":{"pagination":{"page":1,"pageSize":25,"pageCount":1,"total":4}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
